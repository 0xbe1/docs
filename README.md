# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Spice Data

{% hint style="warning" %}
Spice Data is currently in **Beta**. To gain access to longer query ranges and higher rate limits, request an API key at [**https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs**](https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs)****

**Spice Data** is a data platform and set of web3 on-chain data APIs initially supporting Ethereum. It's built and supported by the team at [**Spice AI**](https://spiceai.io).

In addition to supporting standard web3 JSON RPC and WebSocket APIs, Spice Data provides querying for historical on-chain data available in both block-level and time-aggregated result sets.

We're initially providing free [Ethereum Gas Fees](broken-reference) and [Prices](api/prices.md) APIs.

Try them out starting with the [getting started guide](get-started.md).
