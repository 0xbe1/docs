# Spice

## Getting Started

Spice is currently in private alpha, so to request an app tenant complete the form at [https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs](https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs).

Once you have your app created, make some test calls on the sample data.

```
$ curl -u https://api.spiceai.io/v0.1/<orgId>/<appId>/decisions
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you are ready to integrate into your application, follow the code samples for your language.

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
