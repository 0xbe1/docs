# Get started

{% hint style="warning" %}
Spice Cloud is currently in **Private Beta**. Request access at [**https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs**](https://forms.office.com/r/aYp8a7zEPs)\*\*\*\*
{% endhint %}

After you've [**signed up**](sign-up.md) and received access to the Private Beta, follow this guide to get started with Spice Cloud.

## Open the portal

Click the link in your sign up email to open the Spice Cloud Portal.

## Select your demo application

Your Spice Cloud account is initially created with a demo application for you to try now. After logging in, select it on the main dashboard.

## Visualize data

The initial view shows the current environment.

## Add Interpretations

In Spice, an [**Interpretation**](reference/core-concepts.md#interpretations) ****is a time-windowed interpretation of the data. Spice will learn and generate interpretations of the environmental data automatically, however in addition, you can add your own.

Do this on the demo application by clicking and dragging on the chart and then selecting the **Action**.

Notice how the Spice generated Interpretations change as Spice learns from the interpretation you provided.
