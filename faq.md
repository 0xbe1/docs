# FAQ

### What data sources do you have?

Spice currently supports **Ethereum** blockchain data and **Sushiswap, Uniswap-V2, and Uniswap-V3** smart-contract data.

We have plans to add many more chains and contracts prioritized by user feedback, along with other sources of data like more [Prices](api/prices.md). We expect to add **Solana** next.

### How much does Spice cost?

Spice is currently in beta and it's free to [get an API key](https://cloud.spiceai.io).

We plan to always have a free tier and offer free APIs, like the [Gas Fees API](api/ethereum/gas-fees.md).

For customers who need higher request or query limits, service guarantees, or priority support we plan to offer high-value paid tiers based on usage.

### What level of support do you offer?

During the beta, we offer [best-effort support](broken-reference) in our Discord. If you'd like higher priority support or are interested in becoming a [Design Partner](https://www.craft.do/s/bgJFtYzSZwuFXD), please let us know.

### What SQL query engine/language do you support?

We currently use an [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org) based query engine, and support the ANSI SQL standard.&#x20;
